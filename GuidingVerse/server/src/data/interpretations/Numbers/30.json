  "Summary": {
    "General": "Moses addresses the leaders of the tribes of Israel, conveying the Lord's commands regarding vows and oaths. If a man makes a vow to the Lord or swears an oath to bind himself, he must fulfill his word exactly. If a woman makes a vow or a binding oath while young and living in her father's house, and her father hears it but says nothing, the vow stands. However, if her father forbids her on the day he hears, the vow or oath is nullified, and the Lord will forgive her. If she marries while under a vow or a rash pledge, and her husband hears it but says nothing on that day, the vow stands. But if her husband forbids her on the day he hears, he nullifies the vow or pledge, and the Lord will forgive her. Vows made by a widow or a divorced woman are binding. If a married woman makes a vow or oath in her husband's house, and he hears but remains silent, it stands. If he explicitly nullifies it on the day he hears, it is void, and the Lord will forgive her. The husband has the authority to confirm or nullify any vow or oath his wife makes. If he remains silent day after day, he confirms them. If he nullifies them after initially hearing them without objection, he bears her iniquity. These are the statutes the Lord commanded Moses concerning husbands and wives, and fathers and daughters living in their father's house during their youth.",
    "Non-Denominational": "Focuses on the seriousness of vows and oaths made before God, emphasizing integrity and faithfulness in keeping one's word. It outlines the specific conditions under which vows made by women (young daughters, wives) could be confirmed or nullified by male authorities (father, husband), reflecting the social structure of the time. This authority was linked to responsibility; the father/husband could annul a vow but also bore responsibility if they confirmed it inappropriately or annulled it late. The core principle remains the importance of honoring commitments made to God, while providing specific regulations for women within the patriarchal family system.",
    "Baptist": "Emphasizes the sanctity of vows made to God and the importance of fulfilling sworn commitments. It highlights God's ordained structure of authority within the family, where fathers and husbands held responsibility for the vows made by dependent women (daughters, wives). This authority included the power to nullify vows considered rash or inappropriate, thereby protecting the woman and the family. The husband's responsibility is underscored â€“ failing to nullify promptly meant confirming the vow; nullifying later meant bearing the wife's guilt. The passage stresses both personal integrity in commitments and the functioning of God-ordained family headship.",
    "Catholic": "Views vows and oaths as sacred commitments made to God, requiring fulfillment. The regulations concerning women's vows reflect the societal context and principles of family authority and responsibility recognized in the Old Covenant. The father's or husband's authority to confirm or nullify vows is seen as protecting the woman and ensuring vows align with family duties and God's law. This doesn't diminish the woman's personal responsibility but places it within the family structure. The Lord's forgiveness when a vow is nullified underscores divine mercy within these legal structures. These statutes guide responsible commitment-making.",
    "Methodist": "Highlights the importance of keeping promises made to God (vows and oaths) as a matter of spiritual integrity. It addresses the practical application within the family structure, granting authority to fathers and husbands over the vows of daughters and wives. This authority was intended to provide guidance and protection, allowing for the annulment of potentially rash or burdensome commitments made by those under their care. The husband's responsibility to act promptly underscores the seriousness of this oversight. The regulations balance the sanctity of vows with the realities of family relationships and responsibilities.",
    "Lutheran": "Focuses on the Law regarding vows and oaths. Keeping one's word, especially to God, is a matter of Law and reflects God's desire for order and faithfulness. The specific regulations concerning women's vows demonstrate God's ordering of households under male headship (Law) in that era. The father's/husband's ability to nullify vows shows a provision within the Law, preventing rash commitments from becoming binding under specific circumstances. The consequence for the husband who delays nullification (bearing her iniquity) reinforces responsibility under the Law. Ultimately, the Law reveals the need for Christ, who perfectly fulfilled all commitments."
