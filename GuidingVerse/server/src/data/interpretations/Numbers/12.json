  "Summary": {
    "General": "Miriam and Aaron challenge Moses' authority, prompted by his marriage to a Cushite woman and questioning his unique prophetic role. God swiftly intervenes, summoning all three. He affirms Moses' unparalleled relationship, speaking 'face to face,' unlike His communication through visions/dreams with other prophets. He rebukes Miriam and Aaron for their audacity. God's anger results in Miriam being struck with leprosy. Aaron pleads with Moses, acknowledging their sin. Moses intercedes for Miriam's healing. God prescribes a seven-day exclusion from camp as a necessary disgrace before healing. The narrative highlights the seriousness of challenging God's chosen leadership and Moses' distinct position.",
    "Non-Denominational": "Focuses on the sin of jealousy and challenging God-appointed authority. Highlights God's direct defense of Moses, emphasizing his unique humility and intimacy with God. It shows the consequences of sin (leprosy) and the power of intercession (Moses praying for Miriam). Underscores the need for respecting leadership and the importance of purification and restoration.",
    "Baptist": "Emphasizes the sinfulness of envy and speaking against God's chosen servant, Moses. Accents God's clear affirmation of Moses' unique prophetic office and direct communion with God. It portrays the divine judgment on Miriam (leprosy) as a consequence of sin, Aaron's repentance, Moses' gracious intercession, and God's requirement for disciplinary separation before restoration.",
    "Catholic": "Interprets the conflict as arising from envy regarding Moses' authority and possibly prejudice. Notes God's solemn defense of Moses, distinguishing his 'face to face' communion from ordinary prophecy. Miriam's leprosy is seen as divine chastisement for attacking God's anointed. Aaron's plea and Moses' intercession demonstrate fraternal charity and the power of prayer. The seven-day exclusion mirrors ritual purification laws.",
    "Methodist": "Stresses the dangers of envy, gossip, and questioning God's chosen leaders. Highlights God's swift response to defend Moses' unique relationship and humility. Miriam's leprosy serves as a stark warning against rebellion. It underscores the themes of confession (Aaron), forgiveness and intercession (Moses), and God's restorative justice (healing after temporary exclusion).",
    "Lutheran": "Underscores the sin of rebellion against God's established order and His chosen prophet, Moses, fueled by jealousy. Affirms God's clear declaration of Moses' unique status and direct communication. Views Miriam's leprosy as God's righteous judgment on sin. Notes Aaron's confession, Moses' intercessory role (reflecting Christ), and the necessary period of public shame before restoration."
