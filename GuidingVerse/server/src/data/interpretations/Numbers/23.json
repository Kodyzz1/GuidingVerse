  "Summary": {
    "General": "Balaam instructs Balak to build seven altars and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for sacrifice at Bamoth-baal. After the sacrifices, Balaam goes aside to seek a word from the Lord. God meets Balaam and gives him a message. Balaam returns to Balak and the Moabite princes and delivers his first oracle: He cannot curse whom God has not cursed. He describes Israel as a people dwelling apart, not reckoned among the nations, and declares their immense population ('Who can count the dust of Jacob?'). He concludes by wishing his own end might be like that of the righteous Israelites. Balak complains that Balaam has blessed Israel instead of cursing them. Balaam reminds him he must speak what the Lord provides. Balak then takes Balaam to the field of Zophim on Mount Pisgah, builds another seven altars, and offers sacrifices. Balaam again seeks the Lord. God meets him and puts another word in his mouth. Balaam delivers his second oracle: God is not human that He should lie or change His mind; He has blessed Israel, and Balaam cannot reverse it. He declares there is no misfortune or trouble ('iniquity' or 'perverseness') seen in Israel by God (in the sense of allowing a curse), that the Lord their God is with them, acclaimed as King. God brought them from Egypt with strength like a wild ox. He states definitively that no sorcery ('enchantment') or divination can prevail against Israel, and marvels at what God has wrought for them. He prophesies Israel's lion-like strength, consuming its enemies. Balak tells Balaam to stop â€“ neither curse nor bless them at all. Balaam again reiterates he can only speak what the Lord says.",
    "Non-Denominational": "Focuses on God's overruling power, turning Balaam's intended curse into powerful blessings for Israel. Despite Balak's pagan rituals and repeated attempts from different locations, God dictates Balaam's words. The oracles highlight Israel's divine blessing, separation, vastness, God's faithfulness, His presence with them, their invincibility against sorcery, and their ultimate triumph. Balaam, though hired to curse, becomes an instrument proclaiming God's unchangeable purpose for His people.",
    "Baptist": "Emphasizes God's sovereign determination to bless Israel, thwarting Balak's efforts and Balaam's probable desire for reward. The pagan sacrifices are ineffective against God's will. Balaam's oracles powerfully declare God's unchanging nature ('God is not a man, that he should lie'), His irreversible blessing upon Israel, His presence as their King, their protection from demonic powers ('enchantment'), and their future strength. The story demonstrates God's faithfulness to His covenant people despite opposition.",
    "Catholic": "Highlights the futility of Balak's attempts to manipulate supernatural forces against God's chosen people. The sacrifices offered are pagan rites. God directly intervenes, giving Balaam specific pronouncements (oracles) that bless Israel. These oracles emphasize God's fidelity ('God is not human that he should lie'), His unique relationship with Israel (dwelling apart, God with them), their protection from occult powers, and their divine destiny. Balaam acts as a prophet compelled by God to speak truth, demonstrating God's sovereignty over prophecy and divination.",
    "Methodist": "Focuses on God's unwavering commitment to bless Israel, overriding human schemes and even the prophet's own inclinations. Balak's rituals fail to produce the desired curse. God gives Balaam words of blessing instead, emphasizing Israel's unique status, God's steadfastness ('He hath blessed, and I cannot reverse it'), His protective presence, and their immunity to sorcery. This demonstrates God's sovereign grace and power working through prophecy to affirm His positive intentions for His people.",
    "Lutheran": "Sees God's Word triumphing over human attempts at manipulation and cursing. Balak's works-based approach (sacrifices) is useless against God's declared blessing (Gospel). Balaam is constrained by God's Word. The oracles declare key truths: God's faithfulness and immutability, His gracious election and blessing of Israel (prefiguring the Church), His presence ('shout of a king'), and protection from evil forces ('no enchantment'). This reveals God's sovereign grace and power to preserve His people and ensure His promises prevail."
