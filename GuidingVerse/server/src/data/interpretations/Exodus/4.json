  "summary": "Moses continues to object to God's call, expressing doubts about his ability to speak. God gives him three signs: turning his staff into a snake, making his hand leprous and healing it, and turning water into blood. God also promises to help him speak and appoints Aaron as his spokesman. Moses returns to Egypt with his family, but God seeks to kill him until Zipporah circumcises their son. God tells Aaron to meet Moses, and they gather the Israelite elders who believe Moses' message.",
