  "summary": "A Levite couple has a son and hides him for three months. When they can no longer hide him, they place him in a basket in the Nile. Pharaoh's daughter finds and adopts him, naming him Moses. Moses grows up in Pharaoh's palace but later kills an Egyptian for beating a Hebrew. When Pharaoh seeks to kill him, Moses flees to Midian. There he helps the daughters of Reuel (Jethro) and marries Zipporah. Meanwhile, the Israelites cry out to God in their suffering.",
