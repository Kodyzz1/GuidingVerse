  "chapterSummary": {
    "General": "Genesis 50 concludes the book. Joseph mourns and embalms Jacob. Pharaoh grants permission for a large, high-ranking funeral procession to Canaan. A solemn mourning ceremony is held at Atad before Jacob is buried in Machpelah per his command. After returning to Egypt, Joseph's brothers fear retribution and plead for forgiveness, supposedly relaying Jacob's dying wish. Joseph weeps, reassures them ('You intended evil, but God intended good to save many lives'), and promises continued provision. Joseph lives to 110, seeing great-grandchildren. Before dying, he reaffirms God's promise to bring Israel back to Canaan and makes them swear to carry his bones with them. He dies, is embalmed, and placed in a coffin in Egypt, awaiting the Exodus.",
    "Non-Denominational": "Focuses on themes of grief and mourning, fulfilling final requests (Jacob's burial), fear and forgiveness, Joseph's unwavering theological perspective (God's sovereignty over evil), reconciliation, generational continuity, faith in future divine action (Exodus), the significance of burial in the promised land (Jacob and Joseph), and the conclusion of the patriarchal era.",
    "Baptist": "Highlights Joseph's faithfulness in honoring his father and God. The brothers' fear reveals lingering guilt, while Joseph's response ('Am I in the place of God?') shows humility and unwavering trust in God's sovereign plan ('God intended it for good'). Joseph's final words express strong faith in the Exodus and land promise, linking the patriarchs' story to Israel's future redemption.",
    "Catholic": "Emphasizes the solemnity of Jacob's funeral rites and Joseph fulfilling his oath. Views the brothers' plea and Joseph's forgiveness as a model of reconciliation, rooted in recognizing God's providence. Joseph's famous statement ('God intended it for good') is a key theological principle. His instruction about his bones signifies enduring faith in God's covenant promises and hope in the resurrection.",
    "Methodist": "Stresses the emotional aspects of grief, fear, and reassurance. Joseph's consistent grace towards his brothers, even after Jacob's death, is central. His articulation of God working good through evil provides profound comfort and perspective. The chapter concludes with Joseph's own faith-filled preparation for death and belief in Israel's future return.",
    "Lutheran": "Sees Joseph pointing away from himself ('Am I in the place of God?') towards God's judgment and grace. The brothers fear Law/retribution, but Joseph offers Gospel/reassurance based on God's overarching good plan. Both Jacob's and Joseph's burial requests demonstrate faith focused on God's promise concerning Canaan, not on Egypt's security.",
    "Presbyterian": "Underscores God's sovereignty as the main theme, explicitly stated by Joseph ('God intended it for good'). The events demonstrate God overruling human sin for His redemptive purposes. Joseph's forgiveness flows from this understanding. His final words reaffirm the certainty of God's covenant promises regarding the Exodus and the land.",
    "Pentecostal": "May focus on the powerful demonstration of forgiveness and reconciliation flowing from Joseph's relationship with God. His statement ('God intended it for good') is seen as inspired wisdom. Joseph's final instructions about his bones are a prophetic act, keeping Israel's hope alive for the promised return.",
    "Anglican": "Notes the formal mourning and burial procedures. Highlights the final resolution of conflict between Joseph and his brothers, grounded in Joseph's theological understanding. Values Joseph's statement on God's providence. Views Joseph's final testament as an act of faith, connecting his death to God's future promises for Israel.",
    "Orthodox": "Emphasizes the proper honoring of Jacob through burial rites. Joseph's forgiveness demonstrates Christ-like mercy. His statement ('God intended it for good') reflects deep understanding of God's economy. Joseph's instruction regarding his bones signifies profound faith in the promise of the land and ultimately, the resurrection, desiring his remains to rest in the Holy Land."
