    "General": "Genesis 45 marks the emotional climax where Joseph, overwhelmed by Judah's plea, reveals his identity to his terrified brothers. He weeps loudly, assures them it was God's plan ('God sent me ahead of you to preserve life'), not their malice, that brought him to Egypt to save them from famine. He instructs them to bring Jacob and their families to Goshen, promising provision. An emotional reunion ensues, especially with Benjamin. Pharaoh, pleased with the news, offers wagons and the best of Egypt for Jacob's family. Joseph provisions his brothers generously (favoring Benjamin again) and sends them home with gifts for Jacob. Jacob is initially stunned by the news but revives upon seeing the wagons, resolving to see Joseph before he dies.",
    "Non-Denominational": "Focuses on themes of revelation, emotional release, forgiveness (initiated by Joseph), divine providence overriding human actions, reconciliation, family restoration, God's plan for preservation, generosity, and the revival of hope (Jacob). Joseph explicitly reframes their sinful act as part of God's saving purpose.",
    "Baptist": "Highlights Joseph as a type of Christ, offering forgiveness and life despite past wrongs. Emphasizes God's sovereignty in using evil for good ('God sent me') for the preservation of His covenant people. Notes the genuineness of Joseph's forgiveness and the beginning of family healing, culminating in Jacob's revived faith.",
    "Catholic": "Stresses Joseph's profound act of mercy and forgiveness, revealing his identity amidst tears of compassion. Views Joseph's statement ('God sent me') as a key theological insight into divine providence working through human history. Notes the joy of reconciliation and Pharaoh's magnanimity as part of God's provision.",
    "Methodist": "Focuses on the powerful emotional catharsis of the revelation and reunion. Highlights Joseph's gracious interpretation of events, attributing his journey to God's plan for salvation, thus freeing his brothers from debilitating guilt. Emphasizes the themes of forgiveness, reconciliation, and God's overarching care.",
    "Lutheran": "Sees Joseph's revelation bringing both Law (terrifying the brothers initially) and Gospel (his forgiveness and explanation of God's saving plan). Joseph's words ('God sent me') demonstrate God's ability to bring good out of sin. Jacob's revived spirit shows the life-giving power of good news.",
    "Presbyterian": "Underscores God's sovereign plan meticulously worked out; Joseph explicitly articulates that God orchestrated these events for covenant preservation ('preserve a remnant'). Joseph's forgiveness flows from his understanding of God's purposes. Pharaoh's favor is seen as God moving the heart of a king.",
    "Pentecostal": "May emphasize the prophetic nature of Joseph's statement ('God sent me') and the emotional release as a work of the Spirit. Joseph operates in grace and forgiveness. Jacob's spirit reviving can be seen as a spiritual quickening in response to God's faithfulness.",
    "Anglican": "Notes the dramatic revelation, Joseph's compassionate reassurance, and his clear articulation of divine providence. Highlights the themes of forgiveness, reconciliation, the practical steps for family reunion (move to Goshen), and Jacob's restored hope.",
    "Orthodox": "Views Joseph's revelation and forgiveness as a profound act reflecting divine mercy. His interpretation ('God sent me') emphasizes God's economy of salvation working through human actions, even sinful ones. The reunion and Jacob's revival signify the restoration of life and hope within the covenant family."
