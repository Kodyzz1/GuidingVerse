  "chapterSummary": {
    "General": "Genesis 2 provides a more detailed account of the sixth day of creation, focusing on the creation of Adam, the Garden of Eden, the mandate given to Adam, the creation of Eve from Adam's side, and the institution of marriage. It emphasizes humanity's relationship with God, the environment, and each other in the initial state of innocence.",
    "Non-Denominational": "Focuses on God's rest (Sabbath), the intimate creation of man (dust + breath), the provision of the Garden, the establishment of human responsibility (work/keep, obey command), the inadequacy of animals for companionship, the creation of woman as a suitable partner, and the foundation of marriage as a 'one flesh' union characterized by innocence.",
    "Baptist": "Emphasizes the institution of the Sabbath rest by God. Stresses the special creation of Adam from dust and Eve from his side, highlighting male headship and complementarity in marriage (often literal interpretation). Views the command regarding the tree as a test of obedience. Underlines the original goodness and innocence before sin.",
    "Catholic": "Highlights the Sabbath rest as prefiguring eternal rest in God. Focuses on the dual nature of man (body from earth, soul/life from God's breath). Sees the Garden as symbolic of original harmony. Interprets the creation of Eve from Adam's side as signifying their unity and equality in dignity. Views marriage as a sacrament instituted by God, a covenant of life and love.",
    "Methodist": "Focuses on God establishing a rhythm of work and rest (Sabbath). Stresses the personal relationship between God and humanity ('LORD God'). Highlights humanity's role as stewards ('work and keep'). Sees the creation of Eve fulfilling Adam's need for companionship and establishing marriage as a divinely ordained, intimate union.",
    "Lutheran": "Views the Sabbath rest as God delighting in His completed work. Emphasizes the unique creation of man, reflecting God's image. The command concerning the tree is seen as God establishing His authority and requiring faith/obedience. Marriage is God's institution for companionship, procreation, and mutual support, reflecting original righteousness.",
    "Presbyterian": "Highlights the institution of the Sabbath. Stresses the covenantal relationship established with Adam (often termed the Covenant of Works), involving representation, responsibility (work/keep), and probation (the command). Views the creation of Eve and marriage as divine institutions reflecting complementarity and unity.",
    "Pentecostal": "Often emphasizes the literal aspects of the narrative. Focuses on the impartation of God's breath (Spirit) giving life to Adam. Highlights the provision and beauty of Eden. Sees the creation of Eve as God's solution for Adam's loneliness and the divine institution of marriage.",
    "Anglican": "Affirms the Sabbath ordinance. Focuses on the narrative's anthropological significance: humanity formed from earth yet enlivened by God, placed in a nurturing environment, given responsibility, and created for relationship (with God and each other). Views marriage as divinely instituted for companionship and unity.",
    "Orthodox": "Views the Sabbath as God entering His creation and blessing it. Sees Adam's creation (dust + breath) signifying humanity as a bridge between material and spiritual. The Garden represents potential communion with God. Eve's creation from Adam signifies their shared nature and unity. Marriage is seen as a path towards union and potentially a sacrament."
