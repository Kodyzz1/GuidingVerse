  "chapterSummary": {
    "General": "Genesis 6 describes the growing corruption and violence of humanity, symbolized by the union of the \"sons of God\" and \"daughters of humans\" and the presence of Nephilim. God regrets creating humanity, limits human lifespan, and resolves to wipe out life with a flood due to pervasive wickedness. However, Noah finds favor with God, who instructs him to build an ark to save himself, his family, and pairs of all creatures.",
    "Non-Denominational": "Focuses on the pervasive nature of human sin infecting society, God's grief and righteous judgment against wickedness, the limitation of human lifespan as a consequence, the special grace shown to Noah (finding favor), Noah's righteousness and faithfulness, and the divine command and provision for salvation through the ark.",
    "Baptist": "Emphasizes the total depravity of humanity. Interprets \"sons of God\" often as fallen angels (demons) cohabiting with women, leading to unnatural offspring (Nephilim) and extreme wickedness. God's grief leads to righteous judgment (Flood). Highlights Noah finding grace (unmerited favor) and his righteousness by faith, leading to obedience in building the ark as God's means of salvation.",
    "Catholic": "Describes the spread of sin and corruption. Allows for various interpretations of \"sons of God\" (fallen angels, Sethites, tyrants) but emphasizes the resulting wickedness. God's 'regret' is anthropomorphic, signifying His sorrow over sin. His decision to flood is just, but His mercy singles out the righteous Noah. The ark is seen as a prefigurement of the Church, offering salvation.",
    "Methodist": "Focuses on the escalation of sin and its devastating consequences. Notes God's profound sorrow ('grieved') over human corruption. Highlights God's judgment as a response to pervasive evil but emphasizes His saving grace extended to Noah, who walked with God. Noah's obedience in building the ark is crucial.",
    "Lutheran": "Views the chapter as describing extreme human wickedness under sin's dominion. Interprets \"sons of God\" often as Sethites intermarrying with Cainites, leading to apostasy. God's 'regret' reflects His sorrow over sin. The Flood is God's righteous wrath. Noah finds grace (is declared righteous by faith) and becomes the recipient of God's covenant and commands for preservation.",
    "Presbyterian": "Highlights the radical extent of human depravity after the Fall. Interprets \"sons of God\" often as the godly line of Seth intermarrying with the ungodly, leading to widespread apostasy. God's just judgment (Flood) is decreed against universal sin. Noah finds grace in God's sight, demonstrating God's sovereign election. God establishes His covenant with Noah and gives instructions for the ark.",
    "Pentecostal": "Often interprets \"sons of God\" as fallen angels, emphasizing the supernatural demonic influence contributing to extreme wickedness and violence. Stresses God's grief and righteous judgment. Highlights Noah finding grace and his obedience to God's specific instructions for the ark as an act of faith.",
    "Anglican": "Describes the spread of wickedness and violence. Acknowledges different interpretations of \"sons of God\"/Nephilim. Emphasizes God's sorrowful judgment upon sin. Highlights Noah finding grace and being chosen due to his righteousness. Views the ark as God's ordained means of deliverance and a symbol of salvation.",
    "Orthodox": "Views the intermarriage (whether angelic or Sethite/Cainite) as representing a catastrophic mingling leading to widespread corruption. God's 'regret' signifies deep sorrow. The Flood is God's judgment but also a cleansing/re-creation. Noah, found righteous, becomes the focal point of God's plan to preserve life. The ark symbolizes the Church saving believers from the flood of sin."
