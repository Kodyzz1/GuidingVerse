  "summary": "Two years after interpreting the cupbearer's dream, Joseph is called to interpret Pharaoh's dreams. Pharaoh dreams of seven fat cows being devoured by seven thin cows, and seven healthy ears of grain being swallowed by seven thin ears. Joseph interprets these as seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine. He advises Pharaoh to store grain during the plentiful years. Impressed, Pharaoh makes Joseph second-in-command over Egypt. Joseph marries and has two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. The seven years of plenty end, and famine begins.",
