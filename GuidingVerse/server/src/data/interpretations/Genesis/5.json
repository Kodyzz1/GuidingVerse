    "General": "Genesis 5 provides the genealogy from Adam to Noah through the line of Seth, contrasting with Cain's line in chapter 4. It lists the patriarchs, their ages at the birth of their named son, their remaining lifespan, and their total age at death, emphasizing the long lifespans before the Flood and the continuity of the godly line leading to Noah.",
    "Non-Denominational": "Focuses on tracing the lineage of promise through Seth, demonstrating God's faithfulness in preserving a people for Himself despite the Fall. Highlights the reality of death ('...and he died') as a consequence of sin, the extraordinary pre-Flood lifespans, the exceptional piety of Enoch ('walked with God') leading to his unique departure, and the hope associated with Noah.",
    "Baptist": "Emphasizes the historicity of the genealogy and the long lifespans. Traces the godly line of Seth, contrasting it with Cain's. Views the repeated phrase 'and he died' as underscoring the curse of death from Genesis 3. Highlights Enoch as an example of faith and fellowship with God, rewarded by being taken directly by God. Sees Lamech's prophecy about Noah hinting at future relief.",
    "Catholic": "Traces the lineage from Adam through Seth, preserving the line from which the Messiah would come. Notes the long lifespans as potentially literal or symbolic of God's blessing/different conditions. Underscores the universality of death ('and he died') due to original sin, with Enoch as a rare exception due to his righteousness (taken by God). Lamech's hope in Noah points towards future salvation.",
    "Methodist": "Focuses on the faithfulness of God in continuing the human race through Seth's line. Highlights the pattern of life and death ('and he died'). Sees Enoch's walk with God as a model of piety and intimate relationship, resulting in his unique translation. Notes the hope expressed at Noah's birth for relief from the cursed ground.",
    "Lutheran": "Views the genealogy as historical, tracing the line of the Church/believers. Emphasizes the reign of death ('and he died') after the Fall. Enoch stands out as a man of faith who walked with God and escaped physical death through God's grace, foreshadowing believers' translation. Lamech expresses hope for comfort through Noah.",
    "Presbyterian": "Traces the covenant line through Seth, demonstrating God's faithfulness to His promise (Gen 3:15). Highlights the reality and consequence of sin ('and he died'). Views Enoch's walk with God and translation as evidence of God's grace and special favor upon the faithful. Lamech's prophecy about Noah connects him to the theme of relief from the curse.",
    "Pentecostal": "Often interprets the genealogy and lifespans literally. Emphasizes Enoch's close walk with God as a model for believers, leading to his supernatural translation. Highlights the contrast between the godly line of Seth and the ungodly line of Cain. Sees Lamech's words about Noah as prophetic hope.",
    "Anglican": "Traces the Sethite lineage, demonstrating continuity and God's preservation of a faithful line. Notes the long lifespans and the recurring refrain of death. Highlights Enoch's exceptional piety ('walked with God') and his mysterious disappearance ('God took him'), signifying divine favor. Notes Lamech's hopeful naming of Noah.",
    "Orthodox": "Views the genealogy as tracing the righteous lineage from Adam. Emphasizes the consequence of the Fall: mortality ('and he died'). Enoch represents a life lived in close communion with God, whose translation signifies the possibility of overcoming death through divine grace, prefiguring ascension/deification. Lamech hopes for rest through Noah."
