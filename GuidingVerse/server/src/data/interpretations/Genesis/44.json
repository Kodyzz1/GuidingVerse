  "chapterSummary": {
    "General": "Genesis 44 details Joseph's final, most severe test. He instructs his steward to return the brothers' money again but plant his personal silver divination cup in Benjamin's sack. After they depart, the steward pursues, accuses them of theft, and 'finds' the cup with Benjamin. Distraught, the brothers return to Joseph. Judah, speaking for all, acknowledges their 'guilt' (implying God's judgment on past sins) and offers all as slaves. Joseph refuses, demanding only Benjamin. This prompts Judah's powerful, impassioned plea, recounting Jacob's love for Benjamin and offering himself as a slave in Benjamin's place to prevent Jacob's death from grief. This demonstrates a profound change in the brothers, particularly Judah, who now prioritizes his father's well-being and Benjamin's safety over his own freedom.",
    "Non-Denominational": "Focuses on the themes of severe testing, engineered crisis, corporate guilt vs. individual responsibility, the power of intercession, sacrificial love (Judah for Benjamin/Jacob), transformation of character, and the culmination of Joseph's plan to gauge his brothers' repentance and change of heart, particularly concerning Rachel's son.",
    "Baptist": "Highlights Joseph's intense test designed to reveal genuine repentance. Judah's speech is seen as evidence of true transformation, demonstrating selfless love and willingness to substitute himself for Benjamin, protecting his father. This points towards God's work in changing hearts and fulfilling His purposes through painful trials.",
    "Catholic": "Emphasizes the severity of the test and the brothers' shared anguish (tearing clothes). Judah's plea is a model of intercession, filial piety, and self-sacrifice, showing profound moral development. His willingness to suffer for Benjamin contrasts sharply with their past actions towards Joseph, indicating true contrition.",
    "Methodist": "Stresses the emotional climax of the testing. Judah's transformation from past jealousy (towards Joseph) to present self-sacrifice (for Benjamin) is central. His speech demonstrates empathy, responsibility, and profound love for Jacob, showcasing the potential for genuine change through God's grace and difficult circumstances.",
    "Lutheran": "Views the planted cup as part of the Law's work, bringing guilt to the surface (Judah: 'God has uncovered your servants' guilt'). Joseph's insistence on taking only Benjamin confronts their past sin. Judah's plea, offering himself, shows a heart changed by grace, willing to suffer for another, pointing towards substitution.",
    "Presbyterian": "Underscores God's sovereign control over the events, using Joseph's test to bring about the brothers' genuine repentance and demonstrate their changed character. Judah's speech fulfills his earlier pledge and shows God's plan to restore the family relationship through costly sacrifice and intercession.",
    "Pentecostal": "May see Judah operating under the conviction of the Holy Spirit, empowered to make a selfless plea. The test reveals the depth of change God has worked in their hearts. Judah's intercession is Spirit-filled, motivated by love and a desire to prevent his father's suffering.",
    "Anglican": "Notes the dramatic structure of the test, the brothers' despair, and the pivotal role of Judah's speech. It highlights themes of justice (perceived), mercy (pleaded for), substitution (offered), and the profound change in Judah's character, essential for reconciliation.",
    "Orthodox": "Focuses on the test revealing the brothers' repentance and readiness for reconciliation. Judah's self-sacrificial offer mirrors aspects of Christ's sacrifice, taking the penalty for another. His love for Jacob and Benjamin demonstrates true conversion of the heart, paving the way for forgiveness."
