  "General": "The Book of Genesis serves as the foundational book of the Bible, narrating the story of beginnings. It covers God's creation of the universe and humanity, the entry of sin into the world (The Fall), the global flood and Noah's ark, the dispersion of nations at Babel, and the lives of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, detailing the establishment of God's covenant relationship with His chosen people."
