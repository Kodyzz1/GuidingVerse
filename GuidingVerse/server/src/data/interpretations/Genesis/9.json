    "General": "God blesses Noah and his sons, repeating the command to be fruitful and multiply. He establishes human dominion over animals, permits eating meat (forbidding blood), and institutes capital punishment for murder based on the sanctity of human life (imago Dei). God formally establishes the Noahic Covenant with Noah, his descendants, and all creatures, promising never again to destroy the earth by flood, setting the rainbow as the covenant sign. Later, Noah plants a vineyard, becomes drunk, and lies uncovered. Ham sees his father's nakedness and tells his brothers, who respectfully cover Noah. Noah awakens, curses Ham's son Canaan, predicting servitude, and blesses Shem and Japheth.",
    "Non-Denominational": "Focuses on the post-Flood blessing and mandate (fill the earth), the new relationship with animals (fear, permission to eat meat), the critical importance of the sanctity of human life (imago Dei, capital punishment), the establishment and sign (rainbow) of the universal Noahic Covenant (promise of preservation), the continuation of human sin (Noah's drunkenness, Ham's disrespect), and the resulting prophetic curse on Canaan and blessings on Shem and Japheth.",
    "Baptist": "Highlights God's blessing and renewed mandate. Notes the permission to eat meat with the prohibition of blood. Emphasizes the establishment of human government/capital punishment to protect life made in God's image. Stresses the Noahic Covenant and the rainbow sign as God's promise. Views Noah's drunkenness and Ham's sin as examples of continued human fallenness, leading to specific prophetic consequences.",
    "Catholic": "God blesses Noah, renewing the creation mandate. Permission to eat meat is granted, excluding blood (life). Establishes the natural law principle of protecting human life (imago Dei), justifying capital punishment. The Noahic Covenant, sealed by the rainbow, is a universal promise of God's mercy. Noah's sin and Ham's disrespect show fallen human nature persists; the curse/blessings foreshadow future relationships.",
    "Methodist": "Focuses on God's blessing and re-establishment of order. Notes the dietary changes and the prohibition of blood. Underlines the sanctity of life principle and the basis for societal justice (capital punishment). Emphasizes the Noahic Covenant as God's gracious promise of stability, signified by the rainbow. Views the family incident as a sad display of human weakness and disrespect, resulting in prophetic pronouncements.",
    "Lutheran": "God blesses Noah, reaffirming dominion and fruitfulness. Permission to eat meat (without blood) is given. The command regarding murder underscores the value of life created in God's image and establishes temporal authority. The Noahic Covenant and rainbow signify God's promise to preserve creation. Noah's sin and Ham's dishonor demonstrate continued sin after the Flood, leading to prophecy.",
    "Presbyterian": "Highlights God's common grace in blessing Noah and re-establishing creation order. Notes the permission for meat (no blood) and the institution of civil government (capital punishment) reflecting God's justice and value of life (imago Dei). The Noahic Covenant is God's universal promise to preserve the world. Noah's sin, Ham's transgression, and the resulting curse/blessings illustrate ongoing depravity and God's sovereign ordination of future events.",
    "Pentecostal": "Emphasizes God's blessing and empowerment to fill the earth. Notes the new dietary laws and the seriousness of shedding blood. Highlights the divine institution of protecting life (capital punishment). Focuses on the Noahic Covenant as God's faithful promise, sealed by the rainbow. Views Noah's failure and Ham's sin as warnings about dishonor, leading to prophetic declarations with lasting implications.",
    "Anglican": "Notes God's blessing and renewal of the mandate to multiply. Discusses the permission for meat-eating (excluding blood) and the institution of capital punishment for murder, reflecting the sanctity of life. The Noahic Covenant is God's enduring promise to all creation, signified by the rainbow. The incident with Noah and his sons illustrates human frailty and the consequences of disrespect.",
    "Orthodox": "Highlights God's blessing renewing creation. Notes the change in diet (permission for meat, no blood). Emphasizes the sanctity of human life (imago Dei) as the basis for forbidding murder. Views the Noahic Covenant and rainbow as God's universal promise upholding creation. Noah's drunkenness and Ham's sin show the persistence of passion and disrespect; the curse/blessings have historical/prophetic significance."
