    "General": "Genesis 19 details the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Two angels arrive in Sodom and are reluctantly hosted by Lot. The men of the city surround Lot's house, demanding to rape the visitors. Lot offers his daughters instead, but the mob persists. The angels rescue Lot, strike the attackers blind, and urge Lot to flee with his family as judgment is imminent. Lot hesitates but is dragged out with his wife and daughters, warned not to look back. He negotiates to flee to the nearby town of Zoar. As God rains down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah, Lot's wife looks back and becomes a pillar of salt. Abraham witnesses the destruction from afar. The chapter ends with a disturbing epilogue: Lot and his daughters dwell in a cave; believing they are the only survivors, the daughters get Lot drunk on consecutive nights and conceive children by him, resulting in the births of Moab and Ben-Ammi, the ancestors of the Moabites and Ammonites."
