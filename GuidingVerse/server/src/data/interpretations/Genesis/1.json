    "General": "Genesis 1 outlines the foundational narrative of creation, detailing God's orderly and purposeful formation of the heavens, earth, light, sky, land, seas, vegetation, celestial bodies, sea creatures, birds, land animals, and culminating in the creation of humanity in His image over six distinct 'days'. Each stage is declared 'good' by God, with the complete creation deemed 'very good'.",
    "Non-Denominational": "Focuses on God as the sovereign Creator, the orderliness and purposefulness of creation, the concept of creation 'ex nihilo' (out of nothing) by God's spoken word, the inherent goodness of the created order, and humanity's unique place as image-bearers with delegated authority.",
    "Baptist": "Emphasizes God's absolute sovereignty and power displayed in creation 'ex nihilo'. Views the six days as literal 24-hour periods (common interpretation). Highlights the goodness of creation before the Fall and humanity's creation in God's image as foundational for human dignity and purpose.",
    "Catholic": "Affirms God as the sole Creator of all things, visible and invisible. Interprets the 'days' often figuratively as logical stages or periods, not necessarily 24-hour days. Stresses the inherent goodness of creation, the Trinitarian hints (Spirit hovering, Word spoken), and the dignity of humanity created in God's image ('imago Dei') destined for communion with Him.",
    "Methodist": "Focuses on God's majestic power and wisdom in bringing order out of chaos. Sees the goodness of creation reflecting God's nature. Emphasizes humanity's creation in God's image, implying relationship, responsibility (stewardship), and potential for holiness. Often open to various interpretations of the 'days'.",
    "Lutheran": "Highlights creation by God's powerful Word ('Let there be...'). Views the account as historical fact, affirming God's complete authority over creation. Emphasizes the goodness of the original creation and humanity's unique status as reflecting God's image, later marred by sin.",
    "Presbyterian": "Stresses God's sovereignty, purposefulness, and methodical ordering of creation. Affirms creation 'ex nihilo' and the goodness of God's work. Interprets the 'days' often as a literary framework (Framework Hypothesis) or analogous days. Emphasizes the covenantal aspect, with humanity created in God's image to be His representatives and stewards.",
    "Pentecostal": "Often emphasizes a literal six-day creation. Highlights the active role of the Holy Spirit (v. 2) in creation. Focuses on God's power displayed through spoken commands and the supernatural origin of life. Sees humanity's creation in God's image as imparting spiritual capacity and authority.",
    "Anglican": "Affirms the doctrine of creation by God. Allows for diverse interpretations of the 'days' (literal, figurative, literary). Stresses the order, beauty, and goodness of God's creation and humanity's unique creation in the 'imago Dei', reflecting God's rationality, relationship, and dominion.",
    "Orthodox": "Views creation as a liturgical act of God, bringing order and beauty from chaos. Interprets the 'days' often symbolically or liturgically. Emphasizes the role of the divine Logos (Word) and Spirit in creation. Sees the cosmos as inherently good and humanity created in God's image and likeness, called to grow into the likeness through synergy with God."
